# SoundboardApp
A mobile soundboard app made with Java. It scrapes sounds from a website and populates buttons with sounds to make a soundboard.

This is an incomplete project and will add improvements/fixes in the future.
Learned new concepts like Fragments, Activities, and all kinds of input methods.
Reinforced previously learned concepts such as classes and serializables.
Also used with Firebase to handle all authentication and database related matters.

Here is the login/signup page, complete with basic checks such as valid email, strong password, show/hide password.
As a user does a login the app will check if the user exists and allow entry. Likewise, with a signup, it will check if that user has already existed.

Within the landing page, a user can make profiles to add their sound's into.

The search page scrapes data from a sound website and stores it as a button that can play sound.
